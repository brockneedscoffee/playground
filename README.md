# Playground

This repo is just a series of snippets, training exercises, examples, etc. that I have used while either prepping for an interview or to brush up on something that I have not used in awhile. I hope that making it public and adding to it regularly, it will help me stay sharp and others as well. If you want to see more examples of things feel free to open an issue.
